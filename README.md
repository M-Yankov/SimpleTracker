# SimpleTracker - The repository is archived
An simple android app for track routes. Strava is not working on old Android Devices. This app will contains functionality to track a GPS route.

I'am stopping developing this, it's too much strugle using Android 6.0 as a main phone. Also for development requires hacks, difficult approaches and
time that I want to spend elsewhere.  
It's OK to use the current state of the project. If you want to contribute just ping me GMail: mihail.yankov.1337
